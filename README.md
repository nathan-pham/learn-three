## Usage

You can use VS Code Live Server to preview the code and `deno run --allow-run run.ts <folder_name>` to watch for changes to rebuild the JS bundles. You do need `deno` to run these demos because I am not including a "bundled" version (including a full unminified version of Three.js in every file would take forever to upload).

`run.ts` is just a helpful utility to watch the changes in a specific folder, rather than running the full command for yourself or using a package.json for scripts (which is just pure irony).
