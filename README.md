# Learn Three.js

Learn Three.js with TypeScript

## Usage

You can use VS Code Live Server to preview the code and `deno run --allow-run run.ts <folder_name>` to watch for changes to rebuild the JS bundles. However, you do not need `deno` to run these demos because I am including a "bundled" version (created with `deno bundle`); each `<folder_name>` should be a standalone project or experiment.

`run.ts` is just a helpful utility to watch the changes in a specific folder, rather than running the full command for yourself or using a package.json for scripts (which is just pure irony).
